# BookStoreApp

We can search books by title or author name. We can sort books by price, ratings and authors. We can add to cart (if we hover on title of the book, we will see a button `add to cart`). We can proceed to checkout. We need to fill up the details of the checkout form. We will be able to see those form values on console as we did not build backend. This bookstore app is responsive.

## How to build and deploy

Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
